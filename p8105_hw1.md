\#Problem1 \#\#problem1(1)

Create a data frame comprised of:

-a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution -a
logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater
than 0 -a character vector of length 10 -a factor vector of length 10,
with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
set.seed(3883)

ploblem1_df = tibble(
  ran_samp = rnorm(10),
  gr_than_0 = ran_samp > 0,
  vec_char = c("perfect", "H", "o", "m", "e", "w", "o", "r", "k", "lol"),
  vec_factor=factor(c("iron", "gold", "silver", "silver", "silver", "gold", "iron", "silver", "gold", "iron"))
)
```

\#\#problem1(2)

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
